## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I have done data analysis in excel and used R for an introductory stats class but it was very minimal use. I don't know R that well but I have also used it for view NetCDF data with help from a friend.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I am a detailed person so I think that will be helpful when it comes to making nice visualizations.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I am very new to R, and as a learner I need to know all the details before I get the big picture and that can be difficult when it comes to coding and languages.
